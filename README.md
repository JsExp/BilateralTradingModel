# A bilateral resource trading model

This is the reimplementation, amendment and extension of paper `Small-scale markets for bilateral resource trading in the sharing economy.`[1]

One mistake in this paper: the penalty of loan `Î±` should not be `1 plus interest rate of a bank`, instead, it equals to only `the interest rate of a bank`.
